## About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer with a knack for building creative and robust applications. My work spans a range of technologies, and I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new ideas to solve interesting problems. When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring Ghana or traveling outside the country; I also love capturing moments through photography.

I'm primarily focused on backend and distributed systems. My tech stack includes:

- **Programming Languages & Frameworks:** Python, C#, .NET, Golang
- **Databases:** Postgres, Elastic Search, Redis, MongoDB
- **APIs:** REST and GraphQL
- **Tools & Platforms:** AWS, Git & GitHub, Docker & Kubernetes, NIFI, Apache Kafka

## My Interests Outside of Coding

Beyond the code, I enjoy:

- **Exploring Tech Trends:** Keeping up with the latest in AI, blockchain, and more.
- **Creative Pursuits:** [E.g., digital art, photography, music production, etc.]
- **Outdoors & Fitness:** [E.g., hiking, cycling, or any outdoor adventure.]
- **Learning New Things:** Whether itâ€™s a new language, a culinary skill, or a hobby, I love expanding my horizons.
